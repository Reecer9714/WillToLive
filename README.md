GameMaker 1.4 Survival Island Game

This project started as a way to figure out procedural terrain generation. Then became something I kept adding new ideas to.
I keep coming back to it to either adding a new feature or tweaking an old one.

The project took a real game form when I used it for the Ludum Dare 38 Jam. The jam caused me to create a menu and death screen, which made it feel like a more complete game. It also made me rethink about what the players were able to figure out about the game without help.
